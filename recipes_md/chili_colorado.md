## Ingredients

- 5 cups chicken stock, divided
- 4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed
- 4 dried árbol chiles, stemmed and de-seeded
- 3 dried ancho or pasilla chiles, stemmed and de-seeded
- 3 pounds|1.5 kg chuck or brisket
- 0.25 cup (50 mL) grapeseed or vegetable oil, divided
- 1 large white onion, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 2.5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 6 cloves garlic, divided
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 bay leaves
- 6 large (12 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 cup (90 g) shredded sharp cheddar or jack cheese
- 0.5 cup (60 g) crumbled cotija cheese

## Instructions

- In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups stock to a simmer. 
- Meanwhile, set a skillet over medium-high heat and toast the peppers (in batches, if need be) until they’re fragrant, 
  slightly charred, and a little more pliable. Transfer them to a heatproof bowl, pour the simmering stock over them 
  (weight down with a small bowl if they won’t stay submerged), and set aside to steep for 30 minutes. 
  When they’re soft, cut them open and scrape out some or all of the seeds (leave them in for spicier chile), then use 
  a blender to purée them with the steeping liquid until completely smooth.
